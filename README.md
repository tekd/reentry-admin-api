# Reentry Resources Hub Administration API

## Installation

Clone this repository and the content directory repository. If you clone them to a shared directory, the default path will work, otherwise modify `config.js`.

To run on your local development machine:

````
  npm install
  npm start
````
The API server will listen on port 8080 and serve two endpoints:

- http://localhost:8080/graphql - the API
- http://localhost:8080/graphiql - the interactive GraphiQL interface. 

You can test by running the example queries in [examples.md](./examples.md)..
